      <p>&lsquo;Know your key shortcuts&rsquo; is the mantra of the productive programmer. I&rsquo;ve chosen to try using the same keybindings everywhere, investing time and learning Vim. And using <a href="https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim">xvim</a> in Xcode. In this article I&rsquo;m going to try to explain why I did this, and I&rsquo;ll share my experience of the process.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Knowing your IDE and being productive in it, is one of the best investments you can do as a programmer. We need to write code, and sometimes we do repetitive tasks if we are involved in bigger projects: Navigation and search, refactoring, some formatting and changing existing code.</p>

<h1>Vi(m)</h1>

<p>vi is a command-line text editor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> is an extended version of the same editor.</p>

<p>The main difference from &lsquo;more modern&rsquo; editors, is that it has two modes, and it&rsquo;s designed for proficiency in a kind of command language where the user specifies where he wants to navigate and what he wants to achieve. It was also designed to be completely controlled with the keyboard.</p>

<p>Many people still use it nowadays, which is surprising given that it looks rather old-fashioned, and that the proliferation of different text editing modes has been massive.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested but not familiar with the editor, you&rsquo;ll find that learning how to use it will be a significant time commitment. There&rsquo;s countless of sources of developers explaining why or why not they&rsquo;d use such editor; you&rsquo;ll find them easily. The sources that inspired me and I go back to from time to time are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html">Why, by Jon Beltran de Heredia</a>: Very old source but explanatory for somebody not familiar with the editor.</li>
<li><a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/">Daniel Miessler&rsquo;s intro</a>: Very well written examples and thinking mode that goes with the editor.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Investments</h1>

<p>Getting familiar and productive with your IDE is a time investment. It can take you from weeks to years, and it&rsquo;s very recommended you do so, because it&rsquo;s rather useful to produce code with less time to have time for other interesting tasks (or coffee!). If you become fast enough, your thoughts will <em>convert</em> to code almost instantly, delaying the time between thinking what to do and actually doing. This is specially important when dealing with many files or a moderate amount of complexity.</p>

<p>About 3 years ago, I moved all my workflows to command-line. So any use of git, external text file editing, or remote server management, I would do through command line. For the command-line interface I chose vim as my  editor. But I never learnt more than the modes and clumsy editing in one page of text. I would always rely on external editors to do the bulk of my work.</p>

<p>A year ago I was already familiar with Xcode and it&rsquo;s keybindings. I was moderately productive with it, but I felt I had to improve. The main thing I noticed was my constant switching to the mouse to navigate within a file. Being also a user of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/">AppCode</a>, I thought my vanilla Xcode experience was not very productive.</p>

<p>And so I concluded why not try and invest more time with vim, given I would not only use it for iOS development? I installed <a href="https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim">xvim</a> plugin for Xcode 3 months ago, and I don&rsquo;t want to go back to vanilla Xcode. I&rsquo;ll try and give you an overview.</p>

<h1>Pros</h1>

<p>Being proficient with vim has this implications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hands mostly not moving from keyboard for much time; even switching between files can be easily done with keystrokes, so you can move around the project only with keyboard</li>
<li>It may seem obvious, but having control of the whole project with keyboard empowers you as a programmer, makes you focus more, and lets you reach parts of code faster</li>
<li>One muscle memory: I&rsquo;m using vim mode in <a href="http://atom.io">other editors</a>. This means I have to remember less keystrokes. The muscle memory is so strong that I miss it in text editors like gmail. I even started using <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">vimium</a>!</li>
<li>With one muscle memory, as I use command line a lot, so I will edit very fast and go back to the IDE, with no loss of focus.</li>
<li>Many other editors have a kind of vim mode available as plugin. So it is a good investment in my opinion.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Cons</h1>

<p>This may be obvious, but the drawbacks of learning vim:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learning curve: I&rsquo;m only scratching the surface and I&rsquo;ve constantly forced myself to use Vim keybindings 100% of my programming time. There&rsquo;s so much more to learn, and it has very steep learning curve</li>
<li>Integration with IDE: It can sometimes be rocky. My experience with the Xcode plugin has been very positive, but I have had crashes here and there. There can also be some key binding conflicts</li>
<li>Not complete vim: Nothing beats the original editor in terms of functionality and customisation. Using vim this way is a middle ground, but for me personally is a necessary step to continue working with my existing tools, and still learn a new way of moving and editing</li>
</ul>


<h1>Learning process</h1>

<p>As I mentioned, learning vim is a big time investment. It will slow you down at the beginning, but if you are convinced that you want to invest time on it, you&rsquo;ll prevail.</p>

<p>Everybody learns differently, so you must find your way. My suggestions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Print and consult <a href="http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html">graphical Vim cheatsheet</a></li>
<li>Force yourself to only use Vim keybindings for at least a week</li>
<li>Read some introductory posts or books. The ones I mentioned before helped me a lot</li>
</ul>


<h1>The next step</h1>

<p>There&rsquo;s much you can customise and learn. For now I&rsquo;ll try to be faster and more proficient with navigating and editing Objective-C and Swift code. When I&rsquo;m really productive, I&rsquo;ll try and learn more advanced features, mainly graphical mode and macros.</p>

<p>I hope you found the article interesting, and that you also are improving your tooling and productivity as much as I am. <a href="https://twitter.com/miguelquinon">Tell me</a> what you think!</p>
