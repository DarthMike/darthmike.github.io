Having problems code signing and distributing your application written in Swift? I've encountered some, found solutions for them, and [I've written a sum up for Badoo Tech blog](https://techblog.badoo.com/blog/2015/02/09/code-signing-and-distributing-swift/).

Hopefully it will help anybody with similar issues and increase discoverability of the solutions.
