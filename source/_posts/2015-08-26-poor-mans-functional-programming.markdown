It's a very exciting time to be an iOS or Mac developer. The platform moves very fast and we got a new toy (language) to play with: Swift. It's the perfect time to reevaluate, learn and evolve as a programmer, because you will be forced to adopt this new language (yes, I think Swift is the future, 100%).

I want to relate this to the fact that most iOS engineers, or mobile application developers are traditionally familiar with Object Oriented programming paradigm. But Swift offers more than OOP, and if you ever had an interest on Functional Programming, now it's the time to go forth and investigate it.

# Functional programming is...

I don’t want to start defining what functional programming is, there’s [excellent](http://harlankellaway.com/blog/2015/08/10/swift-functional-programming-intro/) resources out there, [check them out](https://www.objc.io/books/).

A beginner, somebody who has always been thinking in an imperative way (OOP is just a way to organize imperative code), might think about functional programmer this way. It is:

- Too abstract
- Not applicable to my problems
- For academics
- What does even ‘pure’ mean?
- I **need** to mutate stuff!
- Meh, I’ll go back to my familiar way of doing things

I’m not claiming that the previous statements are true, I’m just phrasing and accumulating thoughts **I** have previously had. And possibly other developers have also had this.

# Flame wars


# Moving on

I like to [pragmatic](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) rather than zealous. And I think I have an excellent opportunity to learn more about other ways of thinking about building software, different abstractions, and how to fit those into my day to day work as a programmer.

Swift, as [other modern languages](http://www.scala-lang.org/), offers a unique opportunity of change. And change is only available for those who embrace it. I for sure embrace it completely.
