It's a very exciting time to be an iOS or Mac developer. The platform moves very fast and we got a new toy (language) to play with: Swift. It's the perfect time to reevaluate, learn and evolve as a programmer, because you will be forced to adopt this new language (yes, I think Swift is the future, 100%).

I want to relate this to the fact that most iOS engineers, or mobile application developers are fluent and use Object oriented programming paradigm. But Swift offers more than OOP, and if you ever had an interest on Functional Programming, now it's the time to go forth and investigate this paradigm.
