I write code for fun and food. I'm a bit of a history buff. I also love boardgames, mountain trekking, [playing Irish whistle](http://youtu.be/G22EneELiuE) and family time. Welcome to my small space!

Coding-wise, I have worked as as control engineer in the past, and moved to developing iOS apps many years ago and I still enjoy it. I have done some [game development](../games) as a hobby, and generally I like programming as a whole. Learning never ends!

I currently work @ [Peak](http://peak.net), previously [Badoo](http://badoo.com/).
