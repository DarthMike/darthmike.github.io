I write code for fun and food. I'm a bit of a history buff. I also love boardgames, mountain trekking, [playing Irish whistle](http://youtu.be/G22EneELiuE) and family time.

Coding-wise, I have worked as as control systems engineer in the past. I moved to developing iOS apps many years ago and I still enjoy it. I have done some [game development](../games) as a hobby, and generally enjoy software enginneering at many domains and levels, such as Mobile or embedded software. Learning never ends!

I currently work @ [Peak](http://peak.net), previously [Bumble](https://bumble.com/) and [Badoo](http://badoo.com/).
