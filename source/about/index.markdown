I write code for fun and food. I'm a bit of a history buff. I also love boardgames, mountain trekking, [playing Irish whistle](http://youtu.be/G22EneELiuE) and family time.

Coding-wise, I have worked as as control systems engineer in the past, then moved to developing iOS apps many years ago and I still enjoy it. I have done some [game development](../games) as a hobby, and generally enjoy software enginneering at many domains and levels, such as Mobile, embedded software or Web 3.0. Learning never ends!

I'm now focused on building for the decentralized web @ [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz). I've got lots of experience building and improving products used by millions of users, at [Peak](http://peak.net), and previously [Bumble](https://bumble.com/) and [Badoo](http://badoo.com/).
