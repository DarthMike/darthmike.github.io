I write code for fun and food. I love boardgames, mountain trekking, playing my low whistle and family time. Welcome to my small space!

Coding-wise, I have worked as as control engineer in the past, and moved to developing iOS apps many years ago and I still enjoy it. I have done some game development as a hobby, and generally I like programming as a whole. Learning never ends!

I currently work @ [Badoo](http://badoo.com/).
